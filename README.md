# IntelliMisc<br />[![modloader: fabric (shields.io)](https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-fabric-green)](https://fabricmc.net) ![minecraft: 1.18.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/minecraft-1.18.2-brightgreen) ![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/WithLithum/IntelliMisc)

Some really random ideas to add into Minecraft.

## Build

To build IntelliMisc, simply clone the project and run `gradlew build` (or `./gradlew build` if you are using anything other than `cmd` such as with GNU Bash or on PowerShell).

The `jar` file should be in the `build/libs` directory. If not, check if your build is success (especially if Loom has had your environment set up correctly).

## Usage

* Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/) if not already done so.
* Drop the `jar` file into your `mods` folder.

I recommend using a capable launcher like MultiMC and Hello! Minecraft to manage your game instances.
